"""Deterministic lint, typecheck, build, and test blocks — driven by config.

A known command is not a judgement call. Anything whose invocation you can write
down runs here as code — it costs nothing and returns the same answer every
time. Agents are for the parts that need reading and deciding.

The commands themselves are DATA, not code. They live in sssf.config.yaml's
`quality:` block, keyed by name, because the invocation is the only per-repo
thing about a check and the operator already owns that file:

    quality:
      test:      { argv: ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-q"], timeout: 600 }
      lint:      { argv: ["ruff", "check", "."] }
      typecheck: { argv: ["pyright"] }
      # omit a block to skip it; map order is run order

This module is therefore purely managed: it runs whatever the config declares
and stays byte-identical across stamped repos. An empty/absent `quality:` block
runs NOTHING and says so — the honest replacement for the old fake-green echo
placeholders (a wrong-but-plausible command that silently passes is worse than
one that admits it did nothing).

Two rules the config author must honour (see the roster mirror in the cockpit):
  1. argv is a LIST, never a shell string — no quoting bugs, no shell injection.
  2. Call binaries by BARE NAME. Blocks inherit the operator's environment (see
     utils.operator_env), so `uv`, `pytest`, `pnpm` resolve exactly as they do
     in their terminal; never hard-code an absolute path that bakes a machine
     into the trace.
